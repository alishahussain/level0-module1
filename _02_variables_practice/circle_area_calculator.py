# Goal: Write a Python program that asks the user for the radius 
#       of a circle and displays the area of that circle.
#       The formula for the area of a circle is Ï€r^2.
#       See example image in package to check your output.

    lol = turtle.Turtle()
    # Have your turtle draw a circle with the correct radius
    # my_turtle.circle()

    # Call the turtle .penup() method
    lol.penup()
    # Move your turtle to a new x,y position using .goto()
    lol.goto(100,100)
    # Calculate the area of your circle and store it in a variable
    # Hint, you can use math.pi
    math.pi*(px**2)
    # Write the area of your circle using the turtle .write() method
